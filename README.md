# Asteroids clone in Rust

In an effort to learn the Bevy Game Engine, as well as Rust, this is my attempt at creating a clone of Asteroids.

The game contains a basic main menu, the play screen, a pause option, and a game over screen.

The game is controlled entirely with your mouse. Move your mouse to aim, left click to shoot.

Binaries can be found on the releases page, but if you'd like to build the source, you can do so with `cargo run`.
